	<h2>2012 Summer Olympics, London</h2>
	<p>When the 2012 Summer Olympic Games get underway in July, a handful of UCLA athletes will cross the pond to compete in London.</p>
	<p>While many national teams are still finalizing their Olympic rosters, the Bruins should live up to their reputation as strong performers at the Games.</p>
	<p>Since 1919, the school has sent 443 athletes to the Olympics, earning a total of 230 medals. Were UCLA its own country, this feat would place it 14th in the world in overall medal count.</p>
	<h4>Olympic countries UCLA coaches competed in</h4>

	<h2>UCLA golfers Tiffany Lua, Patrick Cantlay represent U.S. in overseas tournaments</h2>
	<h6>Rising athletes to adjust to foreign greens, represent United States in overseas tournaments this summer</h6>
	<p class="byline">By <a href="mailto:scovella@media.ucla.edu">Steven Covella</a>, Bruin Sports senior staff</p>
	<p>This summer, many UCLA students will travel abroad to embark on academic endeavors.</p>
<p>In a way, UCLA athletes Tiffany Lua, a rising senior, and rising junior Patrick Cantlay are doing the same. </p>
<p>But instead of studying history or a foreign language like most students, Lua and Cantlay are studying golf, and they have big exams this summer.</p>
<p>This past weekend, Lua represented the United States in the Curtis Cup in Nairn, Scotland, where she and her U.S. teammates squared off against the team representing Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>In July, Cantlay will be participating in his third PGA Tour major of the year when he travels to Lancashire, England to compete in the British Open.</p>
<p>These international competitions, which players compete in independent of UCLA, provide the Bruin golfers with a valuable experience in several ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does so much for (Lua) in terms of recognition and as part of her resume ... that she has these experiences from the Curtis Cup,&rdquo; said coach Carrie Forsyth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to make the Curtis Cup team, and by being selected it basically indicates that you&rsquo;re one of the top amateurs in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The format of the Curtis Cup is uncommon in golf and presents Lua with a rare opportunity to play for a much larger constituency than the typical golf tournament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your country. It&rsquo;s where you live and who you represent,&rdquo; Lua said before leaving for Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just being able to represent a bigger party than yourself&mdash;especially in golf, being such an individual sport&mdash;is a huge honor and something to embrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from the experience of international competition, both Lua and Cantlay will be exposed to the historic golf culture of Europe.</p>
<p>While Lua is excited about competing against her British and Irish counterparts, she&rsquo;s also looking forward to being a tourist and exploring the roots of the game she loves, which originated in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to stop by castles and other famous golf courses,&rdquo; Lua said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being able to play some of these legendary golf courses and be around the place where golf started is going to be special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cantlay will also be exposed to Europe&rsquo;s prestigious golf scene as he competes in the British Open, the sport&rsquo;s oldest, and arguably most renowned, tournament.</p>
<p>The opportunity to participate in the British Open is the result of Cantlay&rsquo;s elite play over the last year, both in college and as an amateur on the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s played so well that he deserves to get the accolades that he&rsquo;s achieved, and playing in the British Open is extremely well deserved,&rdquo; coach Derek Freeman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be exciting for him. It&rsquo;s a completely different atmosphere when you play over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The differences between college events and the events Lua and Cantlay are playing in do not end with the tournaments&rsquo; formats and large scale.</p>
<p>Both golfers will have to adjust to the different style of golf European links courses demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very hard golf course in the fact that the ball runs out a lot,&rdquo; Freeman said of the British Open host course, Royal Lytham and St. Annes Golf Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit a lot of low knockdown shots ... not high lofty shots. The type of golf is just different&mdash;you have to learn how to hit different golf shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lua left for the tournament ready to embrace the big stage and eager for her experience abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting a lot of pressure, the butterflies and nerves,&rdquo; Lua said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The competition&mdash;that&rsquo;s the biggest thing I&rsquo;m looking forward to.&rdquo;
